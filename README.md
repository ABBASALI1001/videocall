# 📹 VideoCall Project (MERN + WebRTC + Socket.IO)

A **real-world video calling application** built with the **MERN stack** (React + Vite, Node.js, Express, MongoDB).  
This app demonstrates **real-time video calling** functionality with **authentication using JWT**, powered by **Socket.IO** and **WebRTC (Simple-Peer)**.  
The UI is **modern and responsive**, serving as a mini-clone of Zoom.

cp .env.example .env      # Add your environment variables
npm run dev

3. Setup Frontend
cd ../client
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # Add your environment variables
npm run dev               # Start frontend dev server


Frontend will run at: http://localhost:5173 (Vite default)
Backend will run at: http://localhost:5000 (or your PORT in .env)


🔧 Environment Variables

Add a .env file in your cloned project with the following variables:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=
VITE_API_SOCKET_URL=

# Server port
PORT=

# MongoDB Atlas connection
MONGOOSE_CONNECTION=

# JWT secret
JWT_SECRET=

# Frontend URL for CORS
FRONTEND_URL=

 Replace the values with your own configuration.


⚡ Deployment
Frontend (Netlify / Vercel)

Build command: npm run build

Publish directory: client/dist

Add environment variables (VITE_API_BASE_URL, VITE_API_SOCKET_URL, etc.)

Backend (Render / Heroku / Vercel)

Start command: npm start
